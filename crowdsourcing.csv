Avvo is guided by two basic principles:

Provide an unmatched level of transparency. 

Many of the online resources available today only show information about the doctor or lawyer who pays the most to be there. Avvo plays no favorites. They provide an unparalleled level of transparency that shines the same light on all licensed professionals, enabling people who may know very little about law or medicine to make smart, informed decisions.

Provide more information and better guidance. 

They believe that access to easy to understand information about doctors and lawyers, coupled with guidance on how to use that information, is the best way to help people choose the right licensed professional. Information is empowering: the more people learn about their doctors and lawyers, the more comfortable and confident they'll feel seeking help. This benefits patients and great professionals.

A key component of Class Photo Fund is our high payout of revenue.  For each $2.50/download sold, 40% is automatically paid to the school in the photo and 40% is paid to person/entity that uploads a purchased photo.  Uploading a photo includes providing metadata associated with that photo (year, school, town, state, activity). This work forms the basis to create their searchable archive of thousands of old class photos, club photos and team photos.

Utilizing the power of crowdsourcing and online social networks, their motivation for this service is to provide a scalable fundraising platform to help augment school budgets that are under increased pressure and to provide a scalable fundraising model for schools and organizations associated with schools (i.e. PTA, reunion committees, alumni associations). 

By working closely with schools to source, categorize and upload these old photos into a searchable database, schools and PTAs that upload old photos- perhaps sourced from yearbooks in the school library, can collect up to $2/photo downloaded and purchased (80% of gross revenue on each photo).  Their objective is that Class Photo Fund will provide hundreds of millions of dollars annually to schools in America over the next few years. ",,,,,,"
Class Photo Fund was established to raise money for K-12 schools from a legacy but dormant asset- old group pictures.

The service also enables people to search and download photos that represent their personal scholastic, academic and athletic history as represented in the official school group photos they posed for as students.

They will mentor select students, write guest articles on the topic de jour (or topic de mois, as it were) and share their unique perspectives on design and creativity. All of this will be shared publicly, of course, because what's a Feast without company?
Events

Various online events will be held regularly, from streamed talks and webcasts to tutorials and challenges, so you're never left hungry.

They'll also be hanging out offline, at awesome trade shows and events, and will be announcing Feast-specific events around the world — because sometimes it's nice to hang out with people in real life, away from the internets.

",,,,,,"Feast is a place for creative minds to come together to share, create and learn.

Yearly Theme

Feast will have one unifying theme each year. Since this year seems to be all about optimism, perseverance and just generally giving a damn, we decided the theme for 2011 should be “Create a Better World.”
Monthly Topics

Each month we'll focus on a different topic that ties into our yearly theme. The topics will cover just about anything and everything that's considered creative, like graphic design, product design, typography, data visualization, photography, fashion design, interior design and even tasty, tasty food.

The Daily Dot believes that  Internet is made to connect us, not isolate us. Social networking is the largest single activity online. Yet existing publications still cover the Web as if it were a house of curiosities, not a place people call home.Nobody writes about the Web community as a community. Until now.Like traditional community newspapers,they are tribunes, defenders of people’s rights and interests. Their reporting is guided by what the people want and what they need to be informed citizens of the Web.They report on what matters, not on what’s easy, or fast, or available, or convenient.

They report on the most important and relevant topics from within, applying tried-and-true principles drawn from community newspapers to the growing cultures of the Internet, and allow their audience to read the Dot across multiple platforms, where they live, online.Just as the most valuable and informed reporting comes from publications invested in the communities they serve -- towns, cities, and countries -- their staff reports from within the Web localities they inhabit.
